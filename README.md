### Abstract
Abstract:
Information is the currency of democracy, impregnability of the same during transfer and storage has become a challenge in the field of data communication. One of the most efficient solutions to this ever growing problem is cryptography. The cynosure of this paper is the modified encryption and decryption of images using RSA Algorithm and its subsequent application on an image file. It involves splitting of the image so as to procure encrypt-able split files; and finally retrieval of the original image by applying decryption mechanisms. At the end, an efficient approach is established for keeping the image safe.

### Abstract
Abstract:The paper proposes a secure system which will utilize the Aadhar database along with the Electronic Voting Machine units, to authenticate voters by bio-metric means which will be synchronized by Internet of Things. After successful casting of vote, two sets of voting statistics will be stored in the local polling station as well as a centralized register respectively; through a cascade of servers. These will be secured from virtual third-party vulnerability by VMAC encryption. Finally, an impenetrable system of voting can be established by the above method.
