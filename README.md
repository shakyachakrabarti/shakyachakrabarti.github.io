### Abstract
Abstract:
Information is the currency of democracy, impregnability of the same during transfer and storage has become a challenge in the field of data communication. One of the most efficient solutions to this ever growing problem is cryptography. The cynosure of this paper is the modified encryption and decryption of images using RSA Algorithm and its subsequent application on an image file. It involves splitting of the image so as to procure encrypt-able split files; and finally retrieval of the original image by applying decryption mechanisms. At the end, an efficient approach is established for keeping the image safe.
